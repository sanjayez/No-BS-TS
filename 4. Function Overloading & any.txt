interface Coordinate {

//Overloading signatures
function parseCoordinate(obj: Coordinate): Coordinate;
function parseCoordinate(x: number, y: number): Coordinate;

//Implementation
function parseCoordinate(arg1: unknown, arg2?: unknown): Coordinate{
    if(typeof arg1 === 'object'){
        return {
            ...(arg1 as Coordinate)
        }
    } else {

        y: arg2 as number
    }
}

difference between any & unknown:
any could be of any type
unknown is similar to any but must be type coerced before using -> it's a safer form of any
